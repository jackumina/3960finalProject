3960 Final Project: CoWrangler implementation

We recommend putting our code in index.py into a notebook, importing our data files (or any .csv file you would like to wrangle) and run it through that notebook.

This project implements the datetime type cast from the CoWrangler software.

How to run:
  - Download this repo (if you want, or skip to next bullet)
  - Copy and paste code in file into a notebook
  - Run the code in that notebook
  - There will be a Ui that you can interact with to use the program
